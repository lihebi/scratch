#+TITLE: Causal Discovery Playground


R packages:
- https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SELF/index.html

Need to install the following R packages:
- pcalg: =install.packages('pcalg')=
- backShift
- InvariantCausalPrediction
- CompareCausalNetworks

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R") 
biocLite("RBGL")
#+END_EXAMPLE


* TODO CausalDiscoveryToolbox (in python)
https://github.com/Diviyan-Kalainathan/CausalDiscoveryToolbox

* InvariantCausalPrediction (ICP)
- R package:
  https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/InvariantCausalPrediction/index.html

But this still needs to know which data belongs to which exp (but not
necessary what is the exp).

* backShift

- backshift: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/backShift/index.html
- github: https://github.com/christinaheinze/backShift

* CompareCausalNetworks
This seems to be a code base for testing all algorithms. Take a look
first.
